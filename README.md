#GIT

Git is a free and open-source, distributed version control system
that manages changes to files over time.

Git Commands:
git init - The git init command creates a new Git repository.
git add . - This command updates the index using the current content
			found in the working tree.
git commit -m "This is a comment" - is used to provide commit message
			  						directly from the command line without
			  						opening a text editor.
git push origin - Git push origin is a git command 
				  that pushes a local branch(es)
				  to a remote repository (origin).

mkdir - This command creates a new directory or a folder.
echo - This command creates a file.
	   example: echo "Content of the file" > name-of-the-file.repo
	   			this command creates "name-of-the-file.repo"
