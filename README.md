Help Brad to update his repository.
Make a folder name "brad-repo" using mkdir.
Add a file in the brad-repo using echo, and name it with "brad-updated.repo".

mkdir - This command creates a new directory or a folder.
echo - This command creates a file.
       example: echo "Content of the file" > name-of-the-file.repo
		this command creates "name-of-the-file.repo"

if you're done, use git commands to update the ctf8 repository.

#GIT

Git is a free and open-source, distributed version control system
that manages changes to files over time.

Git Commands:
git init - The git init command creates a new Git repository.
git add . - This command updates the index using the current content
			found in the working tree.
git commit -m "This is a comment" - is used to provide commit message
			  						directly from the command line without
			  						opening a text editor.
git push origin - Git push origin is a git command 
				  that pushes a local branch(es)
				  to a remote repository (origin).

hints: follow the git commands orderly.
make sure you're in the "ctf8" folder before you begin with git, not in the "brad-repo".
